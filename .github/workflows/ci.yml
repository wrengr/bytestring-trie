# This GitHub Actions script was modified from from:
#   <https://github.com/haskell/bytestring/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci.yml>
#   (commit/bd3c32c784bde80c9a46b22ef0029e668c954e70) 2021-10-09
# with particular changes taken from <https://kodimensional.dev/github-actions>
# (which has still more stuff we may want to incorporate later).
#
# Once Haskell-CI fully supports generating GitHub Actions scripts,
# we should switch over to using that rather than maintaining this
# file manually.
