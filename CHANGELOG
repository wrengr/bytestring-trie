0.2.7 (2022-03-14):
  * Added:
    - Instances: Eq1, Ord, Ord1, IsList, Show1, Read, Read1, NFData.
    - Methods:   Semigroup(stimes), Foldable(fold,foldMap')
    - Functions: Data.Trie.Internal.{filter,filterA,wither}
  * Performance Improvements:
    - Significantly sped up `size`
    - Misc other changes to the Foldable instance.
    - Reordered data constructors, for better branch-prediction.
    - Fixed quadratic slowdown for priority-queue functions.
    - Reduced quadratic slowdown for functions that reconstruct keys;
      however, it's still asymptotically quadratic:
      <https://github.com/wrengr/bytestring-trie/issues/25>
  * Breakage:
    - Changed the type of Data.Trie.Internal.lookupBy_
  * Technical Debt:
    - Updated the *.cabal file to use Cabal-2.2 format/features.
    - Greatly increased code-coverage of the test suite
    - Added a bunch of benchmarks, including for regression testing.
    - Added Safe/Trustworthy annotations.
    - Cleaning up OPTIONS_GHC and imports.
    - Cleaning up Haddock and adding more @since annotations.
0.2.6 (2021-11-22):
  * Added:
    - Data.Trie.minMatch
    - Data.Trie.Internal.{cata,cata_}
    - intersection functions (HT: Kevin Brubeck Unhammer)
    - Data.Trie.deleteSubmap (HT: YongJoon Joe)
  * Fixed:
    - Adjusting the Applicative, Monad, and Monoid instances to
      avoid warnings from GHC 9.2.1 regarding:
      <https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/proposal/monad-of-no-return>
      <https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/proposal/semigroup-monoid>
    - Fixed a bug in mergeBy
  * Documentation:
    - Documented the order of results for `matches`/`matches_`
  * Technical Debt:
    - Numerous minor tweaks with smart-constructors
    - Greatly increased code-coverage of the test suite
0.2.5.3 (2021-11-02):
  * Fixed:
    - Increasing upper bounds for GHC 9.2.1
0.2.5.2 (2021-10-16):
  * Fixed:
    - Increasing upper bounds to Hackage latest, instead of just GHC 9.0.1
0.2.5.1 (2021-10-16):
  * Fixed:
    - Fixing things to compile under GHC 9.0.1
0.2.5.0 (2019-02-25):
  * Added:
    - Instance: Semigroup
  * Fixed:
    - Fixing things to compile under GHC 8.4 and 8.6.
  * Technical Debt:
    - Removed the obsolete/unused "useCinternal" Cabal flag
0.2.4.3 (2019-02-24):
  * Technical Debt:
    - Moved VERSION to CHANGELOG
  * Fixed:
    - Fixing things to compile under GHC 8.0 and 8.2.  N.B., still
      doesn't compile under 8.4 or 8.6, due to the version limit on `base`.
0.2.4.1 (2015-04-04):
  * Fixed:
    - Data.Trie.Internal: adjusted imports to compile under GHC 7.10.1
0.2.4 (2014-10-09):
  * Added:
    - Data.Trie.Internal.{match_,matches_}, Data.Trie.{match,matches}
0.2.3 (2010-02-12):
  * Added:
    - Data.Trie.Internal.alterBy_
    - Data.Trie.Internal.{contextualMap, contextualMap', contextualFilterMap, contextualMapBy}
    - Data.Trie.Convenience.{fromListWith', fromListWithL, fromListWithL'} as suggested by Ian Taylor
    - Data.Trie.Convenience.{insertWith', insertWithKey', unionWith'}
  * Performance:
    - converted fmap, foldMap, traverse, and filterMap to worker/wrapper
0.2.2 (2010-06-10):
  * Fixed:
    - Corrected a major bug in mergeBy, reported by Gregory Crosswhite
0.2.1.1 (2009-12-20):
    - Added a VERSION file
0.2.1 (2009-02-13):
    - Most recent release before adding a VERSION file
0.1.4 (2009-01-11):
    - The only previous tag
